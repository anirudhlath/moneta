# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in moneta!

## License and sign-off

moneta is licensed under [AGPL-3.0-or-later](LICENSE). By contributing, you agree that your
contributions are licensed under the same terms.

All commits must carry a [Developer Certificate of Origin](https://developercertificate.org/)
sign-off, certifying that you wrote the change or otherwise have the right to submit it under
the project license:

```bash
git commit -s
```

which adds a `Signed-off-by: Your Name <you@example.com>` trailer. Pull requests with unsigned
commits will be asked to rebase before merge.

## Development

```bash
uv sync --all-extras
uv run ruff check . && uv run ruff format --check .
uv run mypy .
uv run pytest
```

CI runs the same checks; PRs need a green run.
